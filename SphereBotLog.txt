SphereBotWheelsDone.rsdoc
-- radius: 75mm
-- added 12V DC motors to wheels, next need to add some method
   for wheel actuators...

4/10/2015
creating git repository and adding SphereBotWheelsDone.rsdoc to new folder CAD_Drawings
I expect this project to grow large enough to need source control

Should probably add the features I want to implement:

So this is intended to be the first in a series of machines that can change shape and by doing so, function
This is also a test run with design spark mechanical which I am not disappointed in at all so far. It's a godsend for a free CAD program.

Anyway:

feature list:

	--- initial form a sphere **
	--- "wheels" each equal subsections of sphere **
	--- "wheels" should extend out and change angle straight before engaging.
	--- circuit must be designed to probably work over bluetooth or something to that effect too take commands about mode and 
	    function

UPDATE:

Found a potentially suitable linear actuator (as in, one small enough for this application... maybe)
that also provided a useful cad file:
